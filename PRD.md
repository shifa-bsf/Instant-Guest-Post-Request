## Overview

The Instant Guest Post Request plugin enables WordPress site owners to accept guest post submissions directly from the frontend without requiring users to register or log in. The plugin streamlines the submission process while giving administrators full control over moderation, notifications, and styling.

1. Simplify the guest post submission process for both visitors and administrators
2. Provide robust moderation tools to maintain content quality
3. Reduce administrative overhead through automation
4. Offer customization options to match site branding
5. Ensure security and spam protection

## Non-Goals

3. Payment processing for premium submissions
4. Advanced SEO optimization tools
